* RACE CONDITION: When one or more thread do racing for shared resource at critical section and it potentially affects the output of program.
*Here Thread runs through without synchronisation.


*Example : Using predicate kind a Example
*Suppose we make a program, checks whether number is divisible by 5 or not. Making an instance varaible and try them to run.
*Making two thread thread1, thread2 where thread1 itself sets value of n divisible by 5.
*thread2 sets value of n, not divisible by 5.
